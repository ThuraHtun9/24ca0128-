        <div class = "c1">
                <ul>
                    <li>Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series, though it was criticized for some early features and the differences
                         between the console and PC versions. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month and remains one of the most played games on Valve's <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)" class = "v"><strong>Steam</strong></a> platform. In December 2018, Valve transitioned 
                         the game to a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play" class = "v"><strong>free-to-play model</strong></a>, focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.</li>
                    <li>The game had an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous games in the series. Teams competed in professional leagues and tournaments, with the game often cited as being among the best in esports.</li>
                    <li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_2" class = "m"><strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong></a>, a major update bringing the game to the Source 2 engine, was announced in March 2023 and released in September. Official matchmaking for Global Offensive was shut down upon the release of the update, though players are still able to 
                        connect to community servers via a legacy version of Global Offensive for outdated devices and platforms unable to run Counter-Strike 2. The game remains playable on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</li>

        <h3 class = "dname3">Development And Release</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the sequel to the popular first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Source, developed by Valve. Global Offensive's development began when Hidden Path Entertainment attempted to port Counter-Strike: Source onto video game consoles.</li>
            <li>During its development, Valve saw the opportunity to turn the port into a full game and expand on the predecessor's gameplay. Global Offensive began development in March 2010, and was revealed to the public on August 12, 2011.</li>
            <li>There were plans for cross-platform multiplayer play between Windows, OS X, Linux, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 players, but this was ultimately dropped so that the PC and Mac versions could be actively updated.[29] On August 21, 2012, the game was publicly released on 
                all platforms except Linux, which would not be released until September 23, 2014.</li>
