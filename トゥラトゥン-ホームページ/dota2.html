            The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. 
            Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. 
            Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles 
            of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player 
            combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.

                Dota 2 is a fantasy-style game consisting of two teams of five players. The teams occupy opposite ends of a map and compete 
                to destroy each other's bases. Players control characters known as 'heroes', who all have different abilities and can grow 
                more powerful during the game.

            <div id = "t2">
            <p>
                In Dota 2, the ranking system is a way to gauge a player's skill level and progression through competitive play. It's a hierarchy 
                that spans from the novice to the elite, reflecting both skill and dedication. Each rank, except Immortal, is further subdivided 
                into five tiers, adding granularity to the progression.

            <h4 class = "dname3">How Does MMR Calibration Work?</h4>
            <p>
                MMR Calibration means that Dota 2 will assign a suitable rank to your profile. In the calibration process you complete 10 matches in solo or party 
                mode so that the system can calculate your skill level and give you the correct Dota 2 rank medal for this season.
            </p>
            <h4 class = "dname3">How Does MMR Recalibration Work?</h4>
            <p>
                What does Recalibrating Dota 2 Do. Players must play ten ranked games to complete the recalibration process. The player will get a new medal and 
                MMR upon completing the required ten games. However, it is worth noting that the previous MMR will be considered for the recalibration process.
